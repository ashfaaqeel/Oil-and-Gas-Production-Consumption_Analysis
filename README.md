<h1> Oil-and-Gas-Production-Consumption_Analysis</h1>

## üìä Project Overview
This project offers a comprehensive analysis of global oil production and consumption trends over a 40-year span (1980-2020) across 17 countries. Using Power BI for data visualization, the project delves into the production-consumption dynamics, reserves distribution, and strategic opportunities for resource optimization.

## üéØ Key Objectives
- Analyze historical trends in global oil production and consumption
- Identify critical gaps between production and consumption across major economies
- Visualize reserves-to-production ratios for strategic planning
- Generate actionable insights for resource optimization

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop**: Primary tool for data analysis and visualization
- **Power Query**: Used for data transformation and cleaning
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Employed for advanced calculations and measures
- **M Language**: Custom functions for data processing

## üìë Dataset Information
The analysis draws on three main datasets:
1. **Production Data (1980-2020)**
2. **Consumption Data (1980-2020)**
3. **Proved Reserves Data**

### Key Metrics:
- **TOE (Tonnes of Oil Equivalent)**
- **BOE (Barrels of Oil Equivalent)**
- **Conversion Rate**: 1000 TOE = 6841.18 BOE

## üîÑ Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Standardized measurement units
   - Managed missing values
   - Removed duplicates
   - Validated data types
2. **Data Transformation**
   - Converted TOE to BOE
   - Created calculated columns
   - Developed time-based aggregations

### Analysis Framework
- **Time Series Analysis**
  - Year-over-Year (YoY) growth calculations
  - Rolling averages for smoothing trends
  - Long-term trend identification
- **Geographical Analysis**
  - Country-wise comparisons
  - Regional patterns
  - Production-consumption gaps

## üìà Key Findings
### Production-Consumption Trends
- Global consumption increased from **1.54bn** to **3.90bn TOE** over the period (1980-2020).
- Significant production deficits identified in various major economies.

### Reserves Analysis
- **Total Global Proved Reserves**: 6,066bn TOE
- Insight into distribution patterns across nations and regions

## üìä Visualizations
The dashboard includes:
- **Production vs. Consumption Trends**
- **Geographical Distribution Maps**
- **Time Series Analysis Charts**
- **Reserves Distribution Visualizations**
- **Country-Wise Comparisons**
